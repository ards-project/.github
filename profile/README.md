# Agentic Resource Discovery (ARD) Standard Project

Welcome to the official home of the **Agentic Resource Discovery (ARD)** standards project. We are a collaborative, open-source initiative dedicated to establishing a federated, domain-anchored standard for cataloging, searching, and discovering agentic capabilities across the web.

Our mission is to enable safe, secure, and interoperable agent-to-agent (A2A) and client-to-agent communications by solving the **trust, discovery, and naming bottleneck** at web scale.

## 🧭 What is ARD?

As the agentic ecosystem scales, agents must dynamically discover and invoke external tools, skills, and secondary agents across organizational boundaries. **ARD** provides the standardized protocol and cryptographic envelope to govern this process:

*   **Search-First Discovery:** Moves away from static "app store" install models, allowing clients to search and index capabilities dynamically.
*   **Context Window Optimization:** Solves context limit bottlenecks by offloading tool selection to dedicated discovery registries, eliminating the need to inject thousands of tool descriptions into the LLM context window.
*   **Artifact-Agnostic Envelope:** Serves as a clean metadata envelope using IANA media types to wrap MCP servers, A2A agents, and static Skills without prescribing internal protocol schemas.
*   **Decoupled Cryptographic Trust:** Decouples logical discovery names (`urn:air`) from mutable physical workload identities (SPIFFE, DIDs), protecting enterprise network topologies while maintaining absolute security via progressive trust verification.
